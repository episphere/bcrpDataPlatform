                        The Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Project is currently harmonizing risk factor and clinical data from participating cohorts. Data is expected to be available for request in late 2022. Data access will be facilitated through this platform, in accordance to the data transfer agreements signed between participating studies (originator) and the BCRPP Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute.
